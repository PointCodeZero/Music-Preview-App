# Music Preview

Music Preview let's you see all albums from your favorite artists and listen a 30 seconds preview of any music in that album.

Music Preview is powered by front-end engines such as React Native, Expo and uses the unique [Deezer](https://developers.deezer.com/) API to integrate fun artists and albums search.
